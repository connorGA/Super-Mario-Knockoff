# Super Mario Saiyans
A classic 2D sidescroller with a twist. Navigate Mario through an oncoming stream of enemy Goombas. If you are skilled enough to collect all 7 Dragon Balls, Mario will turn Super Saiyan!

# How to Play
Navigate Mario through the game using the left, right, and up arrow keys.<br> 
Left and right arrow keys will move Mario horizontally.<br>
Up arrow key allows Mario to jump.<br>
In order to kill enemy Goombas, jump and land directly on their head.<br>
In order for Mario to go Super Saiyan, collect all 7 Dragon Balls. Keep in mind, once Mario is holding 7 Dragon Balls, catching another will restart the count.

# Unsolved Problems for Future Development
I have a sprite sheet created that displays the player sprite(Mario) with blonde Super Saiyan hair. Sizing the sprite was an issue, so for now it was left off. I plan to get it inserted properly so that when player collects 7 Dragon Balls, the player sprite becomes the Super Saiyan itteration of Mario.

I would also like to add some updates to the power ups. Including a timer on the Super Siayan mode and adding some randomeness to where the Dragon Balls drop would make the game more challenging.
